/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Mornings, counted, in words.

   The count of mornings appears on /today, the owner's sheet, /account and
   the receipt, and each of them used to phrase it alone. One of them told a
   person spending their last morning that one was left. The words live here
   once, keyed by the shape of the number (zero, one, many) that
   src/lib/mornings.ts picks, so every surface says the same thing.

   A pack is named by its count and nothing else.
