 *
 * What this file does add is the material the two pages need and the

 *
 *   1. The two lunar-month reckonings, written out with worked pairs. This is
 *      the explanation the shraddha guide exists for.
 *   2. The sixteen shraddha tithis of Pitru Paksha, as a ladder of tithis.
 *      Not as Gregorian dates. `loadMuhuratData()` refuses day-level precision
 *      until a panchang provider is named, and a free reference that quietly
 *      broke that rule would be worse than no reference.
 *   3. The copy of the directory (/panchang, three hundred cities) and of the
